<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The objective of this lab is to teach students various data structures and to explain them algorithms for performing various operations on these data structures. This lab complements the data structures course. Students will gain practical knowledge by writing and executing algorithm by using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables and search trees.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
The experiment "Implementation of Queue using Linked-List", is the implementation of basic principle of Queue, which is FIFO ( First In First Out).
In a linked queue, each node of the queue consists of two parts that is data part and the link part. Each element of the queue points to its immediate next element in the memory.
In the linked queue, there are two pointers maintained in the memory that is front pointer and rear pointer. The front pointer contains the address of the starting element of the queue while the rear pointer contains the address of the last element of the queue.
