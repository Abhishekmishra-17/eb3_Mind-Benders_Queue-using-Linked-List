<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this data structure lab is to implement the Queue using Linked-List . In this lab students are able to understand the concepts Queue and also understand the practical implementation of Queue using Linked-List.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
The experiment "Implementation of Queue using Linked-List", is the implementation of basic principle of Queue, which is FIFO ( First In First Out).
In a linked queue, each node of the queue consists of two parts that is data part and the link part. Each element of the queue points to its immediate next element in the memory.
In the linked queue, there are two pointers maintained in the memory that is front pointer and rear pointer. The front pointer contains the address of the starting element of the queue while the rear pointer contains the address of the last element of the queue.
