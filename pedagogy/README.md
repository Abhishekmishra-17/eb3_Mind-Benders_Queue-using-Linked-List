#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Expository and guided inquiry

<u> <b>Description: </b> The instructional strategy of this experiment is "Problem based", because student will perform the experiment and are able to find the solution of problem statement. The problem statement is in form of input node of linked-list and simulator will show the concept of queue for that particular problem. </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|  Describe the concept <br> of queue and Linked-list. | students will able to<br> perform the basic operation in simulator. | What is basic working principle of Queue <br> A. LIFO<br><b>B. FIFO<br></b> C. LIFO and FIFO both<br> D. None of these 
2.| Describe the algorithm of experiment. | students are able to see the working concept of algorithm<br> according to operation, which <br>has to be perform in simulator | 1 Which is not basic operation of Queue <br> A. enQueue <br> B. deQueue <br> <b> C. isNull <br></b> D. IsEmpty
3.| Experiment with the concept of linked-list <br>in implementation of queue. | students are select the operation<br>and see the performance of that operation<br> in real time animation . | 1 What is an Linked-list <br> <b> A. Data Structure</b><br> B. Data Type <br> C.Fuction <br> D. None of these

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  User is click on<br>"Run" button  |  Simulator will start and<br>it declared the global variables | To initialize the simulator and experiment.
2.|  User is provide some<br>information regarding the<br>experiment | Simulator takes the imput from<br>user and store it in initailized linked-list |To initialize the linked-list<br> and to make user interaction .
3.|  User will able to select the <br>basic operation,<br>which has to be perform in experiment | Simulator show the algorithm<br>pattern and show the animation part<br>of selected operation | For describe the concepts and operation involve in this experiment.
