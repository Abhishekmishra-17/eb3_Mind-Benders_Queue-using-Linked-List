#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Expository and guided inquiry

<u> <b>Description: </b> The instructional strategy of this experiment is "Problem based", because student will perform the experiment and are able to find the solution of problem statement. The problem statement is in form of input node of linked-list and simulator will show the concept of queue for that particular problem. </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|  Recall the concept <br> of queue and Linked-list. | students will able to<br> perform the basic operation in simulator. | Question: In linked list implementation of a queue,<br>the important condition for a queue to be empty is? <br><b>A. Front is equal to Null</b><br>B. Front is equal -1<br>C. Front is equal to Array size-1<br> D. Front==Rear-1 
2.| Describe the algorithm of experiment. | students are able to see the working concept of algorithm<br> according to operation, which <br>has to be perform in simulator | Question:- In linked list implementation of queue,<br>if only front pointer is maintained,<br>which of the following operation take worst case linear time?<br> A. Insertion <br> B. Deletion <br>  C. To empty a queue <br><b>D. Both A and C</b> 
3.| Experiment with the concept of linked-list <br>in implementation of queue. | students are select the operation<br>and see the performance of that operation<br> in real time animation . |Question1: In linked list implementation of a queue,<br>front and rear pointers are tracked.<br>Which of these pointers will change during an insertion into EMPTY queue? <br> A. Only Front pointer<br> B. Only Rear pointer <br><b>C. Both front and rear pointer</b><br> D. No pointer will changed.<br>Question2: In linked list implementation of a queue,<br>where does a new element be inserted?<br>A.At the head of linked-list<br>B.At the centre position of linked-list<br><b>C.At the tail of linked-list</b><br>D.At any positionin the linked-list<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  User is click on<br>"Run" button  |  Simulator will start and<br>it declared the global variables | To initialize the simulator and experiment.
2.|  User is provide some<br>information regarding the<br>experiment | Simulator takes the imput from<br>user and store it in initailized linked-list |To initialize the linked-list<br> and to make user interaction .
3.|  User will able to select the <br>basic operation,<br>which has to be perform in experiment | Simulator show the algorithm<br>pattern and show the animation part<br>of selected operation | For describe the concepts and operation involve in this experiment.
